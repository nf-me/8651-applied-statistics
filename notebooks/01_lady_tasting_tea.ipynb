    "\n",
    "- **Probability of Guessing All 6 Correctly (0 errors)**  \n",
    "  This probability is quite low (around 0.11%). In statistical terms, if a person achieves this result purely by guessing, it would be considered highly unlikely. Consequently, this outcome could be viewed as evidence of actual skill if repeated consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Probability of Guessing At Most 1 Error (≤ 1 error)**  \n",
    "  Allowing exactly one mistake increases the chance to around 4%. Although higher, it is still below the conventional **5% significance level**. Hence, whilst not as stringent as requiring a perfect score, it remains relatively difficult to achieve through random guessing alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Allowing 2 Errors (≤ 2 errors)**  \n",
    "  By permitting two mistakes, the success probability rises sharply to around 24%. This means nearly one in four random guessers could meet this threshold. Since it far exceeds 5%, it would not be considered **statistically significant**, and thus provides little evidence of an actual ability to discern which cups had milk added first.\n",
    "  \n",
    " \n",
    "#### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, lower probabilities indicate stricter tests and a greater likelihood that a successful outcome is due to skill rather than guesswork. Once the probability of success climbs above 5%, the result often stops being considered “significant” in a traditional statistical sense. If we were to accept two errors it would make it much more likely that a person could pass the test by guessing alone, rather than demonstrating any real skill or ability. Therefore we would not accept two errors"
